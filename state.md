# 45Â° Timer Pane

- **Intent:** Mimic the optics of a tilted analog display so the fifth view feels like a physical countertop timer when the phone is laid flat.
- **Perspective:** Dial and typography are skewed to emphasize depth while keeping the circle within the viewport on iPhone screens.
- **Emphasis:** Larger, weightier numerals and heavier shading boost legibility under the angled perspective and reduce the sterile look of the standard views.
- **Interaction:** Controls stay aligned with the dial and share consistent sizing across devices so the experience translates cleanly between mobile and desktop.
